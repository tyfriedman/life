Ty Friedman - Conway's Game of Life

The program works in two modes:

In batch mode, the user enters a file name and the program runs continuously.

In interactive mode, the user enters a r n q or p to add, remove, play once, quit, or play continuously
   If an a is entered with coordinates, the board adds an X at that location.
   If an r is entered with coordinates, the board removes an X at that location.
   If a n is entered, the run function is ran once.
   If a q is entered, the program quits.
   If a p is entered, the program runs the run function indefinitely.

Some initial setups that I used for my scenes can be found at the following website:
